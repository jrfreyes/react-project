## Project Description

A personal health monitoring system that is easy to use and gives a holistic view of the userâ€™s health. It has four pages: health data, recommendations, statistics, and pill intake page. The health data page allows users to keep track of their health data such as body mass index, lean body mass, heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep pattern. The recommendations page provides users with health tips based on their health data. Then, the statistics page allows them to compare their data to other users. Lastly, the Pill Intake page helps users remember to take their medications at the right time. This application aims to help people be more aware of their health for early detection and prevention of illness or disease.
